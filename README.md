# dark-haiku-ip

Converts your internet IP into a dark, degenerate haiku. Basically a gothic rip-off of gabemart's [https://github.com/gabemart/hipku](hipku).

Example: the IP 123.237.12.117 would generate the following dark haiku:

> The sly pale dragon
> hunts in the fetid crater.
> A thousand souls scream.

Norwegian black metal bands will love it! To test it, please visit https://darkhaiku.netlify.app
