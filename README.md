# dark-haiku-ip

Converts your internet IP into a dark, degenerate haiku. Basically a gothic rip-off of gabemart's [hipku](https://github.com/gabemart/hipku).

Example: `123.237.12.117` will generate the following dark haiku:

    The sly pale dragon
    hunts in the fetid crater.
    A thousand souls scream.

Norwegian black metal bands will love it! To test it, please visit https://darkhaiku.netlify.app
